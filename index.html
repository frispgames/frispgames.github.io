    <div class="row">
      <p>A googly-minded bunch of characters with a creative hunger for crafting difficulty addictive games. Meeting along the yellow brick road of high school and university we always had common grounds for gaming and an inner drive to create from our buzzy imaginations. From our vast gaming history over the years, we believe we have a strong sense of what makes games fun and challenging. Our goal at Frisp Games is to give you this spin and to put a fresh splash of colour on the mobile gaming scene.</p>
