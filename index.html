        <h2>Bouncy Bones</h2>
        <p>The first game in our arsenal of  games to come. This spooky and circus themed 2D sidescroller with inspiration from Jetpack Joyride and Flappybird will have you challenged and itching to play more. You play as the main character Widdy, the legless skeleton  who has been tortured and enslaved by an evil wizard called XXXX to perform as part of his freak circus at the castle. With assistance from a handy robot friend called Gizmo, the janitor of the castle zoo, you have been rigged with a trusty helicopter and a spring in place of your legs to escape the evil castle. Your goal is to hover and bounce  through the circus swamp lands taking care to avoid obstacles and projectiles to get as far as possible from the castle.  As part of your perilous escape make sure you collect as many left over circus tickets scattered throughout your journey to redeem for rewards later at the circus store!</p>
