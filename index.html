          The first title in our arsenal of exciting games to come. This spooky and circus themed 2D sidescroller will have you challenged, addictively frustrated and itching to play more. You play as the main character Widdy, the legless skeleton who has been enslaved to perform as part of the freak circus at the carnival castle. Your goal is to pilot Widdy through the circus swamp lands taking care to avoid obstacles and projectiles to escape as far as possible from his withering plight. As part of your perilous escape make sure to collect as many left over circus tickets scattered throughout to redeem for rewards later at the circus store!

      <p>A googly-minded bunch of characters with a creative hunger for crafting difficult addictive games. Meeting along the yellow brick road of high school and university we've always had common grounds for gaming and an inner drive to create from our buzzy imaginations. From our vast gaming history over the years, we believe we have a strong sense of what makes games fun and challenging. Our goal at Frisp Games is to give you this spin and to put a fresh splash of colour on the mobile gaming scene.</p>
