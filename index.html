          The first title in our arsenal of exciting games to come. This spooky circus themed 2D side-scroller will have you challenged and itching to play more. You play as Widdy, the legless skeleton who has been captured and forced to perform in the freak circus at the carnival castle. Your goal is to pilot Widdy through the circus swamp. You'll need to avoid obstacles and projectiles while travelling as far away from the circus as you possibly can. As part of your perilous escape make sure to collect the left over circus tickets scattered throughout to redeem for rewards later at the circus store!

      <p>A googly-minded bunch of characters with a creative hunger for crafting difficult addictive games. Meeting along the yellow brick road of high school and university we've always had common grounds for gaming and an inner drive to create from our buzzy imaginations. From our vast gaming history over the years, we believe we have a strong sense of what makes games fun and challenging. Our goal at Frisp Games is to give you a fresh splash of colour on the mobile gaming scene.</p>
